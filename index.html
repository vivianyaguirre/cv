            <p> I am passionate about combining creativity, analytical thinking, and effective communication to 
                develop innovative, data-driven solutions. I value gaining diverse perspectives and understanding
                every aspect of a project, enabling me to contribute to initiatives that integrate data analytics
                with strategic decision-making across departments and successfully implement meaningful changes. 
                Additionally, I enjoy spending my free time running, working out, listening to music, creating art,
                traveling and spending time with loved ones.</p>
